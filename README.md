# Real-Time Right Eye Detection OpenCV Python With Source Code

The **Real-Time Right Eye Detection system using OpenCV in Python was developed with Python OpenCV**. In this article, the system demonstrates how it can detect a human eye in real time using a webcam.

One of the most successful applications of right eye detection with OpenCV in Python is photo capturing.

When you take a photo of your friends, the eye detection algorithm built into your digital camera identifies where the eyes are and adjusts the focus accordingly.

By the way, if you are new to Python programming and don’t know what a Python IDE is or how it is used, I have prepared a list of the **[best Python IDEs for Windows, Linux, and macOS](https://itsourcecode.com/blogs/best-python-ide-for-windows-2021/)** that will suit your needs.

I also provide a guide on **[how to download and install the latest version of Python on Windows](https://itsourcecode.com/blogs/how-to-download-and-install-latest-version-of-python-on-windows-2021/)**.

To start executing the Right Eye Detection project in OpenCV with Python (including source code), make sure you have installed Python 3.9 and PyCharm on your computer.
